### Decrementing a variable (in this case 99) and printing the current value at each step:

<Oh hi Mark
var is just a 99 CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP!
Yeah, you can say that again var
This is a great party, you invited all my friends
0 is great but var is a crowd
var is as good in bed as he is at getting promotions... Awful!
Yeah, you can say that again var
Everybody betray me. I'm fed up with this world!

### Ð¡onditional expressions:

var = 9
if var != 9:
    print('into if condition')
elif var < 8:
    print('into elif condition')
elif var < 7:
    print('into elif condition')
else:
    print('into else condition')
print('outside the conditional statement')

<Oh hi Mark
