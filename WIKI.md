    var1 and your stupid mother var2                                 |var1 += var2

    Get out! Get out! Get out of var1 's life, var2                  |var1 -= var2

    var1 let's go inside and eat some var2                           |var1 *= var 2

    You are taking var1 apart, var2                                  |var1 /= var2

    var is as good in bed as he is at getting promotions... Awful!   |var -= 1

    You're acting like a kid. Just grow up, var                      |var += 1



### Printing

### Less

    expression1 is great but expression2 is a crowd 


### Increment

### AND

    I'm so happy I have expression1 as my best friend, and I love expression2 so much

### Try/except

    Just what sort of perverted filth are you planning to use operations for?
